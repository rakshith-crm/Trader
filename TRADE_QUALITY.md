Trade Quality

## Trend Trading
- Uptrend
  - Look for long trade entries to move with flow of upward market pressure.
- Downtrend
  - Look for short trade entries to move with the flown of downward market pressure.

## Breakout momentum
- Look for key resistance levels at which price failed to break through multiple times.
- When price breaks such a strong resistance level, it means there is a very high bullish momentum that entered the market

## Fresh Trend vs Trend Exhaustion
- Good going "long trade" at the start of a fresh uptrend
- In contrast, if you're going for "long trade" after the trend has moved significantly, the trend might suffer exhaustion if enough people start taking profits and can result in reversals

## Using higher time frames
- Using higher time frames or window size gives us a more accurate understanding for the market, higher time frames could be both weekly and monthly.

## Time frame confluence
- PENDING

## Divergences
- Divergence are important in capturing the possible reversion in price and trend
  - Wide Divergence
  - Tight Divergence

## Fibonacci Levels
> Are you combining the fibonacci levels with a key level of support / resistance or an area of confluence? 
- 50% (0.5) fibonacci level:
  - "Great quality" fib level as it represents a "deep pullback"
- The area between 50% to 61.8% fib:
  - Again a "great quality" fib level as it represents a "deep pullback"
- 61.8% (0.618) fibonacci level:
  - This is "the best" & "highest quality" fib level because it represents a "very deep pullback" and "best area of value"

## Trend lines
- In an uptrend
  - Does a trend line align with the support levels
  - If a price break occurs that does not align with the trend line, it could signify a possible reversal (Trend Line Break)
- In an downtrend
  - Does a trend line align with the resistance levels
  - If a price break occurs that does not align with the trend line, it could signify a possible reversal (Trend Line Break)
